Test Driven Development 
=======================

This project was created to hopefully give my students a guide they could reuse (multiple times) while they are going through the inital hurdles of becoming TDD developers.   

The videos created for this project have been uploaded to YouTube and the link is defined below.   

* Youtube Link:  
* Pascal's Triangle: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle)  

Branches
------------------------

If you follow along with the tutorial, I have created a few branches that have the completed code up until the next point, so you can follow along.  

* Clean Slate - master  
* Part 1 - end-part-one  
* Part 2 - end-part-two  
* Part 3 - end-part-three  

(I know I made it hard)  

Tools
------------------------

On this video I am using the below fantastic tools, in helping me to complete TDD development in Visual Studio.  

* [RhinoMocks mocking framework](https://github.com/hibernating-rhinos/rhino-mocks)  
* [Nunit testing framework](http://www.nunit.org/)  
* [Jetbrains ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) (a fantastic tool for refactoring and general code development).
